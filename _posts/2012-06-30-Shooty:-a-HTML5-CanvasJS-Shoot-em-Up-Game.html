In this post I am introducing "Shooty" a small HTML5-Canvas based shooter which which is entirely written in JavaScript and should run on any modern browser.<br /><lj-cut text="Read more..."></lj-cut><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4KT2uSCmNdI/T3xv3T53EII/AAAAAAAAAHY/LafeLWnS-HM/s1600/screenshot.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4KT2uSCmNdI/T3xv3T53EII/AAAAAAAAAHY/LafeLWnS-HM/s320/screenshot.png" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_hSw3-Y2itA/T3xwyHmWe6I/AAAAAAAAAHg/zR0WmbL5B8k/s1600/Bildschirmfoto+2012-04-04+um+18.02.10.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="195" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_hSw3-Y2itA/T3xwyHmWe6I/AAAAAAAAAHg/zR0WmbL5B8k/s320/Bildschirmfoto+2012-04-04+um+18.02.10.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><b>Sources/Code</b><br /><br /><a href="http://github.com/dubspeed/shootyJS">github.com/dubspeed/shootyJS</a> <b>(Update:Link fixed)</b><br /><br />Play the Demo: <a href="http://dubspeed.github.com/shootyJS/index.html">shooty.dubspeed.de</a><br /><br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><b>Motivation</b><br /><br />Shooty started out as a training for the Canvas-HTML-element and how to manipulate it via JavaScript. But soon, it got out of control :)<br /><br />I did not start from scratch, I had some artwork laying around from various older game projects. Most of the code has been written in a marathon programming week during vacation.<br /><br /><b>Goals</b><br /><br />My primary goal was to learn about the canvas element in modern browser and if it could provide everything for writing simple games. I wanted to find out weather it could handle multiple bitmap operations, keyboard handling and event handling.<br /><br />This goal has been reached, by writing Shooty. <br /><br />My next goal is to re-make Shooty, to make it easy to add new artwork, functions and levels and to clean the code. <br /><br /><b>Artwork</b><br /><br />The artwork has been created completely with <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP[1]</a> and <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender[2]</a>. Most of the artwork is still work in progress and should be considered as a placeholder for future artwork.<br /><br /><br /><b>Project-Status</b><br /><br />The game is incomplete. It lacks some basic features e.g. sound effects. The source code has grown and is a mess. <br /><br /><b>Next steps</b><br /><br />Freezing the project where it is right now and refactoring the code are the next steps ahead.<br /><br />Like with Dubnotes, I could write unit-tests on the existing code and redesign the app from there, but I think in this case it is inappropriate. <br /><br />Reasons why I think it has be re-done are:<br /><ul><li>Unit tests can not cover all the graphical input / output quite well, I have to split the UI-code from the game engine, creating a new layer of abstraction.</li><li>I have to write the tests from ground up and the code needs to split up into testable functions.</li><li>The coding style is bad.</li></ul><br />From the current state I can easily create an application design and then write the new code within the TDD framework fast.<br /><br /><b>References</b><br /><br />[1] http://www.gimp.org<br />[2] http://www.blender.org
